		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to learn how to manage a local file structure on my computer, add images into index.html files, and upload with GitHub Desktop.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It took me so much time to figure out how to add images into index.html files. I am pretty new to html and css, which need to be extra patient of the code work right.</P>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made.</p>

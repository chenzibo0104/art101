		<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Creating loops are pretty interesting, but we faced some challenges while appending the result. We did a lot of research and finally figured it out.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The main problems we had were appending the outcome. We tried to create a new fuction instead of adding code right below each console.log.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We defeated all the problems and challenges through our teamwork, and here you can see the output.</p>
